Last Modified: November 11, 2024

### Introduction
This is the Privacy Policy of Solidic Labs Inc. (“Eidon”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a subsidiary of Eidon Foundation.


We operate the Eidon mobile application, and related software, including as made available through the collective websites Eidon.ai (collectively, the “Website”). The Website, together with our mobile application, and related devices (collectively, the “Eidon Services”) allow users to participate in a Decentralized AI agent system for data assessment that facilitates access to and use of real world data (the “Eidon Network”).


At Eidon, we believe in the power of real world data from users in training next-generation AI agentic models, and giving our users choice when it comes to how their data is used in such AI training.  We respect your privacy and your rights to any personal information you may provide to us, and we only use the information such as email address, username, password, wallet address, referral codes, IP address, and other personal information that you choose to provide to us for the limited purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
 
We do not sell the information Eidon users provide us.


The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand our data privacy practices. 


We want our users to be informed about how we use their personal data, and we outline the ways the information is used in this Privacy Policy.  By accessing or using the Eidon Services, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy (including the ways we collect, use, and disclose your personal information).  (If you are from countries whose applicable privacy laws require consent, please review our consent-related policies below.)

### What is personal information?
Personal information is any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Under certain laws that may apply to you, personal information may also include information that identifies a specific household or device.

One of the key ways we gather personal information is from User uploads via the Eidon mobile application - for example as part of our Quest Program.  Quests only collect information that our Users explicitly upload, and by submitting information to complete a Quest you consent to providing Eidon with that information.


### Information that we collect
We may collect personal information from you based on the Eidon Services that you choose to access and use. The personal information that we may collect from you in connection with your use of the Eidon Services is as follows:
Account Information: contact and identification information, such as your email address, username, password, digital wallet public address, and any referral codes that you have been provided by us in connection with your use of the Eidon Services;
Technical, Device & Usage Information: your IP address; and
Information provided when you contact us: any other personal information that you choose to provide to us when you contact us for support, provide us with feedback, or otherwise communicate with us.
The types of personal information that we collect will depend on what personal information you choose to provide to us based on your interactions with us and the Eidon Services and Eidon Network.
We may also collect certain non-personal information in connection with your use of the Eidon Services, including information about your use of the Eidon Services and participation in the Eidon Network, the operating system of your device, IP address, application IDs, geolocation, the type and version of your browser, crash data and analytics, other device identifiers, and other information relating to the manner in which you access or use the Eidon Services or participate in the Eidon Network.


### Use of your personal information
We use the personal information that we collect to provide you with the functionality, features, and communications that are available on and through the Eidon Services and to enable us to manage, maintain, and develop our operations. Specifically, we may use your personal information for the following purposes:
manage our relationship with you, including by assisting you to create an account, communicate with us, and provide you with the services that you request;
assess the quality of specific data provided as part of your participation in the Eidon Network which can include photos, videos and other information you choose to share with us;
support the Eidon Network by permitting Eidon to operate the Eidon Network to facilitate access to and use of web data from public websites. The personal information used for this purpose is limited to your IP address;
allow you to participate in, subscribe to, and receive information, news, updates, and promotional materials from us and third parties;
comply with your requests and preferences regarding your use of the Eidon Services and the manner in which we communicate with you;
understand your preferences and values so that we can tailor the Eidon Services and communications to you;
protect us against error, fraud, theft, and damage to our Services, business, and property;
conduct research, analysis, evaluation, and development activities to understand the way the Eidon Services are used and to improve the Eidon Services, Eidon Network, and our general operations, including with respect to the development of new products, services, and opportunities; or
allow us to comply with applicable laws and regulatory purposes.

### Promotional and transactional communications
We will collect your consent prior to sending you promotional emails and other electronic messages (e.g., texts, direct messages), except where we are permitted under applicable laws to send you such messages without doing so. You can opt-out or unsubscribe from receiving promotional messages from us at any time. Promotional messages include our newsletter and updates about our and our partners’ businesses, products, and services.
As part of the Eidon Services, you will receive service related transactional communications about your account and activities. For example, when you create an account or reset your password you may receive an email confirming the details of such activity. You may not opt-out of receiving these transactional communications.


### Disclosure and transfers of personal information
Under some limited circumstances we may disclose your personal information in the manner and for the purposes that are described in the sections below.
Working with third parties. We work with third parties that provide services to us that help us facilitate one or more aspects of the products, services, communications, or features that we offer to you on and through the Eidon Services. We may provide these third parties with your personal information directly or they may collect your personal information from you on our behalf. These include providers of the following types of services:
Customer support service providers. These service providers assist us in helping us track, manage and respond to customer support inquiries. We share personal information such as your Account Information (excluding passwords) and information provided when you contact us with them to enable them to provide these services to us, including in connection with your opportunity to receive rewards.
Communication service providers. These service providers assist us in sending marketing and transactional communications to you. We share your email address with them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Information technology service providers. These service providers enable us to operate our services in a reliable manner by providing us with services like data hosting and cloud computing resources. For example, we may share personal information such as Account Information, information provided when you contact us and Technical, Device & Usage Information with data hosting providers to enable them to provide data hosting services to us.
Professional advisors. In limited cases, we may need to share personal information with our professional advisors like our external lawyers or financial advisors who help us ensure we are compliant with our legal and financial obligations. Depending on the circumstances, we may share any of the information you provided to Eidon through your use of the Eidon Services.  
Use of the Eidon Network. Users of the Eidon Network may have access to your IP address in connection with their participation or use of the Eidon Network to facilitate access to and use of web data through the Eidon Network. In addition, your IP address may be visible to websites when your IP address is being used as part of the Eidon Network.

### Business transactions.
Your personal information described above may, depending on the circumstances, be disclosed to a third party in connection with a business transaction, including a change of ownership of Eidon or its affiliates, the sale of all or certain of our assets, or the grant of a security interest. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the third party that receives your personal information is bound by appropriate agreements that require that your personal information is handled in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Legal requests or protecting rights and interests. We disclose your personal information if we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, protect our or others’ rights, property or interests (such as enforcing our Terms & Conditions) or prevent fraud or abuse of our service. Depending on the circumstances, we may share any of the information described above with these third parties.

Please note that as we may disclose your personal information to third parties (including our service providers) as described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, and otherwise processed outside of your jurisdiction of residence. As such, your personal information may potentially be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities of another jurisdiction where local laws provide for a different level of protection for personal information. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security agencies in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information.
If you would like further information about our policies and practices regarding the transfer and storage of your personal information, including disclosures to third parties such as our service providers, please contact us using the contact details below. If you are in the EEA, UK, Switzerland or BVI, you can find out more about these transfers and the legal frameworks we rely upon for them in transfers outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland or Data transfers outside of BVI. Unless you are based in the EEA, UK, Switzerland or BVI by providing your personal information to us, you consent to our disclosure of this information to our service providers (and other third parties) as described in this Privacy Policy, including those that may be located outside of your jurisdiction of residence.


### Aggregated data
We may disclose aggregated non-personal information and related usage information, which does not contain personal information that directly identifies you, with third parties, including our customers, clients, partners, advertisers, service providers, vendors, suppliers, and content providers.


### Retention of personal information
We do not keep your personal information forever. We will retain your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to complete our dealings with you, or as may be required by law, whichever is longer. For example, we retain Account Information regarding you for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Eidon Services. We also retain personal information for as long as is necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes, and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests.

The precise periods for which we retain your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and the purposes for which we use it. Factors we consider include any minimum retention period required by applicable or recommended best practices and the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter.

### Security and protection of personal information
We maintain commercially reasonable physical, technological, and procedural safeguards that are appropriate based on the sensitivity of the personal information in question. These safeguards are designed to prevent your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or destruction.

Please advise us immediately of any incident involving the loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of your personal information that is relevant to your use of the Eidon Services.

### Your rights related to your personal information
Under the applicable data protection laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), you may have certain rights in relation to our processing of your personal information. Please note that these rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled or obliged to refuse requests where exceptions or exemptions apply under applicable law.


### Some of these rights which may apply (depending on your jurisdiction) include the right:
- to obtain access to, and copies of, the personal data that we hold about you;
- to require us to correct the personal data we hold about you if it incorrect;
- to require us to erase your personal data in certain circumstances;
- to require us to restrict your data processing activities in certain circumstances;

- to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to any of our particular processing activities where you believe this has a disproportionate impact on you;
- to receive from us the personal information we hold about you which you have provided to us, in a reasonable format specified by you, including for the purpose of you transmitting that personal information to another data controller; and
- to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (such as your local supervisory authority where you reside).

If you want to exercise your rights, please contact us to do so at privacy@eidon.ai.

#### Additional information for users in the EEA, UK, Switzerland or BVI:
This section is applicable to you only if you are in the EEA, Switzerland, BVI or the UK. To the extent there is any inconsistency in this Privacy Policy between what we say in this section and in the rest of the Privacy Policy, this section will govern if you are based in the EEA, UK, Switzerland or BVI.
For the purposes of the (1) GDPR, as it applies both in the EEA and the UK; (2) The British Virgin Island’s Data Protection Act (As Revised) (“DPA”); and (3) Swiss data protection law, Eidon is a data controller and can be contacted using the details in section 16 of this Privacy Policy above.

Eidon is a data controller subject to the GDPR only insofar as we are offering goods or services to individuals in the EEA / UK or where the Eidon Services may be used to monitor individuals’ behavior as far as their behavior takes place in the EEA or UK.
Eidon is a data controller subject to the DPA only insofar as we are offering goods or services to individuals in BVI or where the Eidon Services may be used to monitor individuals’ behavior as far as their behavior takes place in BVI.


### Our legal bases for using personal information
Data controllers need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data.
We describe below the purposes of our processing (why we process your information) and our processing operations (how we process your information to achieve each purpose). We also list the categories of your information that we process for each purpose and the legal basis we rely upon to do so.

When it comes to information you provide us in connection with your use of the Eidon Services and/or the Eidon Network we process this information pursuant on the following legal bases:

The information is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you as our user.

We have a legitimate interest in processing that information in order to maintain, run and improve the Eidon Services and Eidon Network for our users and consumers.  This may include to help us develop new services or features for the Eidon Network.

Your explicit consent under applicable law.  

### Data transfers outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland
In the course of providing you with access to and use of the Eidon Services, we may transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland, including to the United States. This means that your personal data will not have the automatic protection of data protection laws, including the GDPR, which apply in the EEA, UK and Switzerland. We rely upon a number of legal frameworks to transfer personal information in such a case. These include:
Adequacy decision. We transfer, in accordance with Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent), personal information to recipients that are in a country that the European Commission, UK or Swiss data protection supervisory authority has confirmed, by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection for transferred data (“adequacy decision”). We rely on these adequacy decisions to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as the United States, UK, EEA, and Canada. The adequacy decisions are available at the following links:
European Commission adequacy decisions;
UK adequacy decisions; and
Swiss adequacy decisions.

Data Privacy Frameworks. We transfer personal data, in accordance with Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent) from the EEA, Switzerland and the UK to recipients in the US that have certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S.

Standard data protection clauses (“SCCs”) and other transfer methods. For countries without an adequacy decision, we transfer, in accordance with Article 46 GDPR (or equivalent), personal information to recipients that have entered into the European Commission, UK or Swiss approved form of transfer contract (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data. We rely on SCCs to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as the British Virgin Islands and The Bahamas. We may, where there is no adequacy decision, alternatively make a transfer based upon Article 46 GDPR (or equivalent) using alternative appropriate safeguards such an approved certification mechanism or code of conduct or binding corporate rules or based upon a derogation provided under law (such as Article 49 GDPR). The European Commission approved SCCs are available here and you can request a copy of the SCCs we use from us by using the contact details above.

### Data transfers outside of BVI
Personal data will be held in, and may be freely transferred between, countries that are located inside the EU and third countries that have adequate protection for your rights in relation to the processing of your personal data, including the United States.
Where a personal data transfer is made to a jurisdiction which provides a level of data protection lower than that prescribed by the DPA, we will take steps to ensure the security and confidentiality of your personal information in accordance with the DPA.
